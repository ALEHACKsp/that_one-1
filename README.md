# that_one - yet another iterated tf2 cheat
  
This is my personal cheat, it only has the features i use or want.  
  
Code unused is code unneeded.  
I like to keep my projects free of bloat to reduce the effects of bit rot.  
I'm not aiming to make this full featured.  
  
Forks are welcome, although pull requests for single feature changes are preferred.  
There's no need for endless renames.  
  
Use instructions:  
file -> new -> project from source -> build it  
If you can't do that yourself, then this is not for you!  
Use the show all files solution option as an automatic filter.  
  
Just don't forget to install or change the esp font.
